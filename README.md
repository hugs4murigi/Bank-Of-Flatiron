## Description
This is my week 1 phase 2 code challenge showing how i did the project.

The project allows a person to Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction.

This should add the new transaction to the table *the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*

Filter transactions by typing into the search bar.

Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
